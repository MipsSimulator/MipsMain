# Pocket Mips32
Mips 32 Simulator for Android <br>
Programmed by Ben Hunt, James Bellian, and Aaron Hunt <br> <br> 
<strong> Introduction </strong> <br>
This Android application is part of an ongoing educational project to simulate a 32 bit MIPS architecture on mobile devices. Many Computer Science students first learn Mips 32 Assembly to understand how memory and registers are manipulated within a computers architecture. This app will provide them a way to experiment with these instructions in a simulated environment that is more accessible than alternatives like MARS. We will continue to update this application to improve stability, increase the instruction set, and add new features. <br>
